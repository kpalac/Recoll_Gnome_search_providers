Gnome Search Providers for Recoll search tool. It divides search into several categories. 
One can link mail box into ~/Mail folder for it to be indexed. 
Pretty simple, but it helped me a lot with large amounts of files, mail and rss news.

Also contains icons and pixmaps from Super Flat Remix theme for look-and-feel, as well as configuration files for Recoll.

INSTALLATION:

    Unpack ZIP
    Run ./install.sh. Use no_deps option to skip installing dependencies and no_icons to skip copying icons if they don't suit your liking
