Gnome Search Providers for Recoll search tool. It divides search into several categories. 

One can link mail box into ~/Mail (or any mail_dir configured) folder for it to be indexed.
One can change configuration (e.g. mail folder, excluded folders in basic search) in ~/.config/gssp-recoll.conf 


Also contains icons and pixmaps from Super Flat Remix theme for look-and-feel, as well as configuration files for Recoll.

Included are scripts for extracting WWW history for Firefox SQLite DBs. For use manually or as a cronjob

Pretty simple, but it helped me a lot with large amounts of files, mail and rss news.

INSTALLATION:

    Unpack ZIP
    Run ./install.sh. Use no_deps option to skip installing dependencies and no_icons to skip copying icons if they don't suit your liking
